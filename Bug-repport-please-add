issue : pwm go NOT from 0 to 100% with values from 0-4095
in the simpleexample
    pwmController.setChannelPWM(0, value); // Set PWM value in channel 0
    create an unsigned int value and perform this experiment:
    try with value 0 = 100% pwm !!! error it should have given 0%
    try with values over 3850 result is wierd wrap arround
